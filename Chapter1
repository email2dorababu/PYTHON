Python is a modern, high-level language suitable for a wide variety of programming tasks.
Python has been used for writing web-based systems, desktop applications, games, scientific programming, and even utilities and other higher-level parts of various operating systems.

It supports procedural programming to object-oriented programming and functional programming.
Python is interpreted language. (interpreted vs compilation)

Python is suitable for programming tasks varying from quick one-off scripts to building huge and complex systems.

20 or 30 lines of code in Java can often be written in half a dozen lines of code in Python

Python Standard Libraries make programming more efficient.
These libraries make it easy to do things such as 
converting date and time values, 
manipulating strings, 
downloading data from websites, 
performing complex maths, 
working with e-mail messages, 
encoding and decoding data, 
XML parsing, 
data encryption, 
file manipulation, 
compressing and decompressing files, 
working with databasesâ€”the list goes on. 
What you can do with the Python Standard Libraries is truly amazing.

The Python Package Index (http://pypi.python.org) provides thousands of additional modules that you can download and install.
many other systems provide python bindings to allow you to access them directly from within your programs.

Note:Python 2.x is the most common version in use today, while the Python developers have been working for the past several years on a completely new, non-backwards-compatible version called Python 3. Eventually, Python 3 will replace Python 2.x, but at this stage most of the third-party libraries (including all the GIS tools we will be using) only work with Python 2.x. For this reason, we won't be using Python 3 in this book.

Once you are familiar with the language itself and have used it a few times, you'll find it incredibly easy to write programs to solve various tasks. Rather than getting buried in a morass of type-definitions and low-level string manipulation, you can simply concentrate on what you want to achieve. You end up almost thinking directly in Python code. Programming in Python is straightforward, efficient and, dare I say it, fun.

Geo-spatial development:
The term Geo-spatial refers to information that is located on the Earth's surface using coordinates.
Geo-spatial development is the process of writing computer programs that can access, manipulate, and display this type of information.
Internally, geo-spatial data is represented as a series of coordinates, often in the form of latitude and longitude values. Additional attributes such as temperature, soil type, height, or the name of a landmark are also often present. There can be many thousands (or even millions) of data points for a single set of geo-spatial data. For example, the following outline of New Zealand consists of almost 12,000 individual data points:
