GIS can also be used to refer to the more general Geographic Information Sciences, which is the science surrounding the use of GIS systems.
In this chapter, we will look at:

    The central GIS concepts you will have to become familiar with: location, distance, units, projections, coordinate systems, datums and shapes

    Some of the major data formats you are likely to encounter when working with geo-spatial data

    Some of the processes involved in working directly with geo-spatial data

Core GIS concepts :
