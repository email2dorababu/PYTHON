Python is a modern, high-level language suitable for a wide variety of programming tasks.
Python has been used for writing web-based systems, desktop applications, games, scientific programming, and even utilities and other higher-level parts of various operating systems.

It supports procedural programming to object-oriented programming and functional programming.
Python is interpreted language. (interpreted vs compilation)

Python is suitable for programming tasks varying from quick one-off scripts to building huge and complex systems.

20 or 30 lines of code in Java can often be written in half a dozen lines of code in Python

Python Standard Libraries make programming more efficient.
These libraries make it easy to do things such as 
converting date and time values, 
manipulating strings, 
downloading data from websites, 
performing complex maths, 
working with e-mail messages, 
encoding and decoding data, 
XML parsing, 
data encryption, 
file manipulation, 
compressing and decompressing files, 
working with databasesâ€”the list goes on. 
What you can do with the Python Standard Libraries is truly amazing.
